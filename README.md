How to play
After running the program, one would see a word that needs to be guessed followed by the player's previous incorrect guesses. 
The player then enters the new alphabet that he/she is guessing. The case of the alphabet that the user is entering does not matter. 
The player can make a maximum of 6 wrong guesses. On the 6th wrong guess, the player loses the game.
